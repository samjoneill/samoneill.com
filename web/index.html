      <h1>Hi, I'm Sam O'Neill.</h1>
<p>I am a Brighton-based design engineer currently working at <a href="https://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a>. Welcome to my online home.</p>
<p>This website is a work in progress. Hopefully that is obvious. I've wanted a website for <em>ages</em>, but for far too long I've let <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">perfect get in the way of good</a>.</p>
<p>I had a ton of ideas, which sounds great, but the reality of that was I never felt I had enough time to make a start. So now I've decided to throw caution to the wind and launch something that took me a lunch hour(ish) to build, and iterate upon it in the public domain.</p>
<p>That's all for now. I'll be adding more soon. In the mean time, I'll direct you to the <a href="https://github.com/samjoneill/samoneill.com">repository</a> â€“ feel free to take a peek under the hood.</p>
