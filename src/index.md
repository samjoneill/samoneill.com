# Welcome

Hello, I'm Sam O'Neill. I'm a Brighton-based design engineer working at
[Clearleft](https://clearleft.com). For the last ten years I've been designing
and building beautiful, performant and accessible websites for clients across
all manner of sectors.

This website is a place for me to (infrequently) [write](/writing) about
front-end development, technology, or anything else that takes my fancy. It's
also a place for me to experiment and tinker without any pressure, and as such,
you might see things changing around here quite often.

If you're interested, you can [view the source](https://github.com/samjoneill/samoneill.com)
for this website on GitHub - feel free to take a peek under the hood.

Thanks for stopping by.
