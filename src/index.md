# Hi, I'm Sam O'Neill.

I am a Brighton-based design engineer currently working at [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com). Welcome to my online home.

This website is a work in progress. Hopefully that is obvious. I've wanted a website for *ages*, but for far too long I've let [perfect get in the way of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good).

I had a ton of ideas, which sounds great, but the reality of that was I never felt I had enough time to make a start. So now I've decided to throw caution to the wind and launch something that took me a lunch hour(ish) to build, and iterate upon it in the public domain.

That's all for now. I'll be adding more soon. In the mean time, I'll direct you to the [repository](https://github.com/samjoneill/samoneill.com) â€“ feel free to take a peek under the hood.
