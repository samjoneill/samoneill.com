title: Hello, internet

I have been using the internet for as long as I remember, and for as long as I
have been using the internet, I have really loved browsing blogs and reading the
posts that they house. Naturally, over the years, the topics and themes of those
blogs that I have perused have changed. When I was younger, I'd read about video
games. I got slightly older and started to read about cars. Somewhere along the
way, I stumbled across blogs about web design.

But as much as I love blogs, I've never had my own. The idea of blogging has
always intrigued me, but never have I actually gone ahead and made one. There
are numerous reasons for this. I don't think I'm too great at writing. Imposter
syndrome lead me to believe that my opinion wasn't worth sharing. I felt, no
matter what I could possibly write about, I would just be repeating something
that someone had said before.

Yet recently these thoughts – these insecurities – have been challenged. I have
felt an urge to write. I have been reminded time and time again of the utility
of writing. How it is a way to turn messy thoughts into coherent ideas, and how
– as we all know – practice makes perfect. So I'm going to give it a go.

This blog will be about the things I make, and how I make them. It will be a
place to geek out about front-end development, design, typography and everything
in between. But I don't want to be shoehorned into only writing about that, so
if I have a thought worth sharing, or come across something that I think may be
of value to others, you can expect to see it here.
